                <p align="justify">Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are two critical concepts
                    that are shaping the way companies operate in today&#39;s world. In the western world, CSR is a voluntary effort
                    by companies to take social and environmental responsibility beyond their legal obligations for the impact of
                    their day-to-day business operations on society. Whereas in India, CSR refers to the voluntary initiatives
                    companies take to contribute to socioeconomic development and improve the quality of life of the
                    communities in which they operate (outside their usual

                <p align="justify"> business operations). As per the Companies Act
                    2013, companies with a net worth of 500 crores or more, turnover of 1,000 crores or more, or net profit of
                    5 crores or more must spend 2% of their average net profit of the last three financial years on CSR activities.
                    On the other hand, the SDGs are a set of 17 goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in
                    2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all by 2030.

                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p align="justify"> The linkages between CSR and SDGs are critical in ensuring that companies&#39; efforts are aligned with the
                            global development agenda. CSR initiatives can support the achievement of the SDGs by addressing social
                            and environmental challenges critical to sustainable development. Companies can choose to align their CSR
                            initiatives with the SDGs that align with their business objectives and the needs of the communities in
                            which they operate.
                            For example, companies can focus their CSR efforts on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) by investing
                            in renewable energy technologies and initiatives that promote energy efficiency or on SDG 3 (Good Health
                            and Well-being) by supporting health initiatives and programs that improve access to healthcare services. By
                            aligning their CSR initiatives with the SDGs, companies can contribute to achieving the global development
                            agenda while creating business value. For example, by addressing environmental challenges through their
                            CSR initiatives, companies can improve their environmental sustainability and reduce their net carbon
                            footprint. At the same time, they can create a positive image and reputation for their brand, which can lead
                            to increased consumer loyalty and market share.
                            A recent Tata Strategic Management Group study found that Indian companies spent approximately INR
                            30,000 crore (approximately $4 billion) on CSR activities in 2019-2020. The study found that the most
                            significant spending was on SDG 1 (No Poverty), followed by SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and
                            SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). This expenditure data highlights the potential impact that
                            companies can have on society and the environment.</p>

                            Critics of CSR policies argue that the mandatory CSR requirement of 2% of a company&#39;s net profit, as
    specified in Section 135 &amp; Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 2013, is not being implemented effectively.
    CSR as a marketing tool to improve their reputation and brand image rather than as a genuine
    commitment to sustainability.
    CSR as a substitute for government responsibility to address societal challenges instead of
    complementing government efforts.
    Inadequate government support and incentives for CSR initiatives make it difficult for companies to
    implement and sustain these initiatives effectively
    Lack of clarity and consistency in regulations makes it difficult for companies to comply with the
    rules and for the government to enforce them effectively.
    The lack of stakeholder engagement and transparency in reporting and evaluation makes it
    challenging to assess the impact and effectiveness of these initiatives.
    Limited impact of CSR spending as much of the funds go to short-sighted CSR activities.

                        <p align="justify">Despite the progress made, there are still significant gaps in implementing CSR and SDGs in India. To
                            ensure effective implementation, there is a need for greater coordination and collaboration between the
                            government, companies, and civil society.
                            Inadequate attention to marginalized communities and local issues: CSR and SDG initiatives may
                            overlook the needs and perspectives of marginalized communities and local issues, leading to limited
                            impact.
                            Inadequate resources and funding for implementation and monitoring, particularly for small and
                            medium-sized enterprises. Leading to the limited engagement of small and medium enterprises
                            Limited impact due to companies prioritizing profit over sustainability.
                            Limited transparency and accountability in reporting: lack of standardized reporting frameworks
                            and metrics for CSR and SDG activities. This makes it difficult to compare and assess the impact of
                            different companies.
                            Limited understanding and awareness of CSR and SDGs among stakeholders.
                            Short-term focus, lacking long-term commitment, resulting in limited impact and effectiveness of
